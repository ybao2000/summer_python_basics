# Five monkeys wanted to divide a bunch of peaches. 
# But they found that the peaches could not be divided evenly. 
# It was evening so they decided to divide those peaches next morning. 

# However, in the midnight, one monkey woke up so he quietly divided all peaches into 5 piles, 
# and found one left after division. 
# So he ate the left one, took his one fifth portion, and remixed the rest peaches. 

# Sometime later, another monkey woke up and tried to divide peaches. 
# So he divided all peaches into 5 piles, also found one left after division. 
# So he ate the left one, took his one fifth portion, and remixed the rest peaches. 

# The rest three monkeys did exactly the same thing.
# Â 
# Question: How many peaches were there at least in the beginning?
